Blogging isn't my biggest priority it seems :-D Oh well, had a busy year, at least got both work and some studies done. But the work load was too much, feels good now that the studies are mostly out of the way until fall. I'll need to figure out what's a suitable amount of coursework to take.

Oh yeah, the land war in Europe didn't help, following that has been a time sink. Who knows how much more suffering that is going to cause, but hopefully we can look into the previous decade or two and figure out retrospectively what Europe could've done to prevent that.

Not sure if I'm going to be big on blogging, but figured this might be a good evening to start. At least there will be something here then :-) Since I'm gearing up for new studies, might as well try to hone my writing skills a bit.

So, in general I'm currently employed at Bitfactor Oy, which will be officially renamed Loihde Factor Oyj tomorrow due to rebranding after being acquired by former Viria, now Loihde. I'm doing data engineering stuff for a customer in the financial sector, I started there at the beginning of June this year. Seems that Covid is getting folks to switch jobs more actively our usual. Of course the market now also hot, recruitment people seem to be switching jobs also. We'll see if the FED tapering off QE will have any effect on this, but for now there's a lot more jobs in the sector than there are professionals. So, happy times if you stay level-headed and do not overburden yourself with work.

So, the studies are going to be about money stuff: Financing at the Oulu University / Oulu Business School. Due to the recent change of jobs, the option of going half-time is not so easy now. But since it's not the main quest, guess I'll try to take it easy and not overload myself. It's really fun to be a student again though, although I do feed a tad of a fraud, not going all in. Guess it's fun to try things this way also. We'll also see if the subject is actually for me, but at least for now I'm eager to learn new stuff. Nice to have something else on the menu, not just work and corona isolation. Jogs have been nice, although I miss gym. And I feel I've betrayed my synths and the piano lately. Maybe I'll need to sharpen up on that front as well.

On the work side it's learning the ropes on new domain, new company, and new customer. Financial sector is blessed with red tape, but things have started to get rolling at least. Starting to get ideas on how to maybe improve things, we'll see. Too bad I need to skip the company autumn party, but at least it's for a good cause: meeting some friends from way back, when we were still young kids at Haapaj√§rvi. It's been too long :-)

A former colleague and a current friend pinged me about doing grammar-based generation of test cases for fuzzing, it's an interesting problem. Another former colleague, aohelin has his blab, but unfortunately it misses backreferences (as a design choice it makes sense, you avoid a lot of wormholes that way and I can't recall if it was for a testing purpose where they were not even necessary) -- so plan B it is. If tomorrow's schedule is not completely borked, we might be able to catch a late lunch (or early dinner). Vising university and starting the work day a bit later, so it's going to be after 6pm I guess.

Some club/association stuff on the back burner: [Pioco ry](https://www.pioco.fi/) needs a way to deal out Slack invites, but Slack is tightening up the API unless you're a paid customer, so there needs to be a semi-automatic process it seems. Also it would be nice to have a member database people could keep up-to-date themselves + a more customized membership application form. There's going to be the anniversary for [Blanko ry](https://www.blanko.fi/), former department of Information Processing Science, and [Tivia Oulu ry](https://tiviaoulu.fi/) in two year I guess so hopefully we can contact a lot of the alumnis about the festivities then. Phoenix framework just pushed out a new version with integrated authentication solution, so I'd definitely need to take a look. Also the yearly meeting needs to be prepped soon, and probably a go/no-go is needed for the Pioconf miniconference. Last year it was canceled.

I recently was nominated as the treasurer for [Tarlab ry](http://www.tarlab.fi/), the local hackerspace, so probably some thing fall on desk on that front as well. At least the account-usage rights need to be transfered at some point.

 [Oulusec](https://www.oulusec.fi/) is on hold, waiting for corona to stop. Maybe something could be arranged before the next Disobey.
 
 And for AWS Oulu something after the corona as well. For the AWS meetups and for the Oulusec both the start of corona killed off a good start. A new try after the dust settles. I also bought a domain for AWS Oulu, but nothing has happened for that yet either. On the professional front I'd need to renew my certificate. That one already expired, but since extra travel to Helsinki is not tempting at the moment and I'm not sure if there's a testing place here in Oulu, I'm not too bothered with that one. Already have enough stuff on my CV on that front for now, and I'm foolishly confident that I can renew that without having to prep too much for it :-)

Yeah, that's a blog I guess!
