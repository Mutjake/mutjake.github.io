### Foreword

```
In a changing economy, accounting has been undergoing a change. From a convenient mechanical device, privately applied to the measurement 
of the status and results of a businesss enterprise, it has grown into an important medium for the public expression of the important facts 
about our vast and complex commercial and industrial society. Where the accountant once was concerned merely with assisting the owners of a 
business to evaluate its operations in money terms, he now must recognize a brod social responsibility. His findings, and the manner in which 
he sets them forth, have become a basis for significant decisions and policies, not only in business affairs, but in economic, social, and 
political matters as well.

-- Foreword by Howard C. Greer in Paton and Littleton (1940), "An introduction to Corporate Accounting Standards"

 * "Book of the century in accounting"
 * Foreword of the book still applies today
 * Earlier accounting was about balance sheets (what are assets, liabilities)
 * 70s: accountants more concerned on the measurement of earnings, how much profit is generated
 * Now: returning to balance sheet oriented accounting
 * Accounting has value, otherwise it would not have existed for such a long time
  - Broadly: accounting helps to allocate the scarce resources in the most optimal way
  - Also important in contracting: important role in multiple interactions

### Session outline

* Economics of accoutning information: demand and supply
* Overview of IFRS: structure, purpose of financial reporting, characteristics of financial information
* Caveat emptor: a lot of domain-specific terms, so do not be afraid to ask!

### Intro to Accounting

* **Financial Accounting (FA):** Process by which the financial transactions, position and results of a firm are recorded and communicated to external stakeholders
* **Managerial Accounting (MA):** Process by which financial position and results of a firm are communicated internally
* In the first part of the course we focus on _Financial Accounting_

# Economics of accounting information

* Financial statements are **demanded** because of their value as a source of information about company performance, financial condition, and stewardship of resources
* The **supply** of financial information is guided by the costs of producing and disseminating it and the benefits it will provide to the company
