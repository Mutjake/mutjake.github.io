### Foreword

```
In a changing economy, accounting has been undergoing a change. From a convenient mechanical device, privately applied to the measurement 
of the status and results of a businesss enterprise, it has grown into an important medium for the public expression of the important facts 
about our vast and complex commercial and industrial society. Where the accountant once was concerned merely with assisting the owners of a 
business to evaluate its operations in money terms, he now must recognize a brod social responsibility. His findings, and the manner in which 
he sets them forth, have become a basis for significant decisions and policies, not only in business affairs, but in economic, social, and 
political matters as well.

-- Foreword by Howard C. Greer in Paton and Littleton (1940), "An introduction to Corporate Accounting Standards"

```

 * "Book of the century in accounting"
 * Foreword of the book still applies today
 * Earlier accounting was about balance sheets (what are assets, liabilities)
 * 70s: accountants more concerned on the measurement of earnings, how much profit is generated
 * Now: returning to balance sheet oriented accounting
 * Accounting has value, otherwise it would not have existed for such a long time
  - Broadly: accounting helps to allocate the scarce resources in the most optimal way
  - Also important in contracting: important role in multiple interactions

### Session outline

* Economics of accoutning information: demand and supply
* Overview of IFRS: structure, purpose of financial reporting, characteristics of financial information
* Caveat emptor: a lot of domain-specific terms, so do not be afraid to ask!

### Intro to Accounting

* **Financial Accounting (FA):** Process by which the financial transactions, position and results of a firm are recorded and communicated to external stakeholders
* **Managerial Accounting (MA):** Process by which financial position and results of a firm are communicated internally
* In the first part of the course we focus on _Financial Accounting_

### Economics of accounting information

* Financial statements are **demanded** because of their value as a source of information about company performance, financial condition, and stewardship of resources
* The **supply** of financial information is guided by the costs of producing and disseminating it and the benefits it will provide to the company

### Demand for financial statements

Users:
* Current and potential investors
  * Should I invest, remain as an investor
* Creditors and lenders (e.g., banks)
  * Should we grant a loan for the company, at what terms
  * Payout function different from investors, i.e. there is an upper bound for the upside (principal + agreed interest)
   - Due to this investors typically are interested in the forward-looking information
   - Lenders less interested in how astronomical the profits might be, just that they're "enough" to cover the loan payments
* Suppliers and customers
* Government: Regulators, Standard Setters, Tax Authorities
* Employees and trade unions
  * If things look good, it's easier to ask for more salary
  * Especially in countries such as Finland and Gerymany, where unions are strong
* Competitors
  * Usually ifficult to extract product pricing data (manufacturing costs / margin)
* Financial community in general (e.g., analysts, investment bankers and consulting firms, rating agencies)
* Environmental agencies
  * Growing, ESG etc.

### Diverse needs of financial statement users

* Investors and creditors are the primary users:
 a) What decisions do they make?
 b) What type of financial information they are **most** interested in?

### Rules of the game: accounting standards

* **GAAP**:
  - Term GAAP is shorthand for *generally accepted accounting principles* - generic definition:
   * "The set of rules and standards issued by various regulatory bodies which companies are expected to comply with"
* Worldwide accounting rules have largely been standardized
  - Advantage: as corporations draw captital and conduct business across national boundaries, a common financial language improves efficiencies
  - Response: International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
  - Standard-setting done in top-down manner nowadays
   * Financial Accounting Standards Board in US
    - Independent, private
    - SEC mandated (but can overrule FASB decisions)
    - Accounting subject to political pressure, so rules not always created by the "ideal accountant"
    - E.g. during crisis the guidelines and solutions can get odd (jury is still out there on this)
     * There can be lobbying to influence accounting standards, for example to avoid certain effects to income statements (due to compensation structures and bonus contracts)
   * International Accounting Standard Board internationally
    - Some old standards still in place, but mostly superceded by IFRS
   * US GAAP vs. IFRS
    - Very similar
    - US GAAP more conservative in some respects
    - Which one is used depends, and sometimes the leadership of SEC affects this (appointed by the president of the US, e.g. Biden selects his own)
    - Countries around the world also use domestic standard to some extent, especially SMEs

### Elements of the IFRS regulation

Skipped for now, revisied in a later lecture

* IFRS regulation consists of the following elements
 - IAS (IFRS) standards
 - Framework
 - IFRIC (SIC) interpretations

* IFRS and IAS standards contain the actual regulations for financial reporting
 - Each standard regulates different issues of financial reporting
 - IAS standards are "old" standards, issued before 2003

* Framework
 - Defines the general principles according to which IFRS/IAS standards are developed (not a standard)

### Structure of IFRS standards

Each standard typically provides guidance on the following general issues:

* **Recognition** of elements of financial statements
* **Measurement** of elements of financial statements
* **Disclosure**

A complete set of financial statement comprises:
* A statement of financial position (balance sheet)
 - Snapshot of the financial status of the company
 - Other statements are a flow between two dates, not a momentary snapshot 
* A statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (income statement)
 - Mistakes here skew the results for the next period (positive or negative)
* A statement of changes in equity
 - Shows things not visible in the income statement
 - Recently more and more things not visible on the income statement are mentioned here, thus it's increasingly important to also comb through this
* A statement of cash flows
 - One element of the balance sheet is tracked during a set timeline to see the initial and the end status, and all the activities during the timeline
 - Differs based on the lifecycle of the company (first investments, loan payments, later on dividends to the investors)
 - Mandatory from 1998 (or 88?) in US, not mandatory in Finland and rarely published by companies in Finland
* Notes, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information

### IFRS Conceptual framework: The objective of general purpose financial reporting

* The objective of general purpose financial reporting is to provide financial information about the reporting entity that **is useful** to existing 
  and potential investors, lenders and other creditors **in making decisions** about providing resources to the entity. Those decisions involve buying,
  selling or holding equity and debt instruments, and providing or settling loans and other forms of credit.
* Investors', lenders', and other creditors' expectations about returns depend on their assessment of the amount, timing and uncertinty of (the prospects for)
  future net cash inflows to the entity. Consequently, existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors need information to help them
  **assess the prospects for future net cash inflows** to an entity.
  
### IFRS Conceptual framework: Desirable characteristics of useful financial information


Decision usefulness 
  * **Fundamental characteristics**
  * Relevance (Materality)
    - **Components**
     * Predictive value
     * Confirmatory value
  * Faithful representation (Reliability)
    - **Components**
     * Completeness
     * Neutrality
     * Free from material error
 
Decision usefulness, **enhancing characteristics**
 * Comparability (Consistency)
 * Verifiability
 * Timeliness
 * Understandability

### Relevance vs. faithful representation illustration

Farmers State Bank is considering a $500,000 loan to Willard Manufacturing. Three items appearing on Willard's balance sheet are:
 a) Cash on hand and in the bank, $20,000
 b) Accounts receivable of $60,000, less an estimate for uncollectibles of $15,000
 c) Accumulated depreciation of $36,000
 
Which items are the most relecant for the bank's loan decision? Which are the most representationally faithful?

- Most important: cash on hand
- A bit short on cash
  * Thus, bank would be interested in the cash-generating capacity of the company since this is required for the loan repayment
- Worrysome that 25% of receivables are uncollectibles
- Depriciation not interesting for the bank
  * More interesting might be the sell price of the tanglible assets, since on default bank would be trying to recoup the loan by selling these

### Other characteristics of financial information: Conservatism

**Conservatism (prudence)** strives to ensure that business risks and uncertainties are adquately reflected in the financial reports:
- i.e., accelerating recognition of bad news (losses) and delaying recognition of good news (gains)
- The current IFRS Conceptual Framework (2010) does not include conservatism as an aspect of faithful representation any more
- Still, accounting conservatism is reflected in many currently used standards

- Two types of prudence:
  * balance sheet conservatism
   - unconditional conservatism
   - If money is expended, it's not counted as an asset until one is discovered: if something tanglible is purchased, it is counted as an asset BUT spending money on e.g. R&D is not an asset until something tangible is produced (e.g. patent, a sellable product)
  * income statement conservatism
   - Aka. conditional conservatism
   - Assets in books need to be proactively depreciated on bad news (let's say a factory machine is forecasted to only last 5 years instead of 10), in the opposite case the depreciation period is elongated (the advantage of this arrives slower)

- H. Jarva did his PhD on accounting conservatism

### Accounting conservatism illustrated

How does the concept of accounting conservatism apply to each of the following situations?

a) Suppose your company purchased land and a warehouse for $5 million. The price was steep, but you were told that a new highway was going to be built nearby. Two months later, the highway project is canceled and your property is worth only $3MM.
b) Suppose instead that you paid $3 million and later learned that the property is woth $5MM because a new highway is going to be built nearby.

### Balance Sheet

* **The Balance Sheet** (or Statement of Financial Position) is a snapshot of the firm's financial position at a point time (e.g., December 31, 2018)
* The Balance Sheet reflects the equality of the Balance Sheet Equation:

Assets (How the money is invested) = Liabilities + Equity (Where the money came from)

### Elements of balance sheet: assets

* An asset is a resource **controlled** by the entity as a result of past event and from which **future economic benefits** are expected to flow to the entity (IFRS Framework).
* An asset is **recognized** in the balance sheet when it is **probable** that the future economic benefits will flow to the entity and the asset has a a cost or value that can be **measured reliably** (IFRS Framework).
  - use of estimates is permitted
* **Not all assets are recognized on the balance sheet**
